In order to monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance, we created a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. 
This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time.
The report will help banks/lenders to make data-driven decisions, track bank loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform bank’s lending strategies.
